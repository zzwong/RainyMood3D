This is a final project for [intro to pc graphics](http://ivl.calit2.net/wiki/index.php/CSE167F2016) class.

We use the OpenGL 4.10 C++ API to render our graphics 3D scene. Some other libraries used include: irrKlang for audio, FastNoise for noise generation, GLFW for mouse and key support, GLM for math, and GLEW.

The project was built in an Xcode environment. If you're feeling brave and want to run our engine, [here](http://ivl.calit2.net/wiki/index.php/BasecodeCSE167F16) is a good resource for getting Xcode setup.
