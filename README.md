# Rainy Mood 3D

This is a final project for [intro to pc graphics](http://ivl.calit2.net/wiki/index.php/CSE167F2016) class.

We use the OpenGL 4.10 C++ API to render our graphics 3D scene. Some other libraries used include: irrKlang for audio, FastNoise for noise generation, GLFW for mouse and key support, GLM for math, and GLEW.
